<h2>How it works</h2>
<body>
    <p>When it comes to advertising, there are many different techniques and key topics. Many huge companies around the world use these as ways to connect to their targeted audience.Three of the biggest strategies these companies are Brand awareness, Marketing mix and Targeted audience. </p>
</body> <p>The term "Brand awareness" may seem a bit confusing when you're hearing it for the first time.Little do people know, brand awareness is what keeps you coming back to your favorite restaurants, drinking your favorite drinks, and buying your favorite retail items. the extent to which consumers are familiar with the distinctive qualities or image of a particular brand of goods or services. For example, when you see the slogan "I'm loving it" or "Just do it" you know those two brands are McDonalds and Nike.  </p>
<p>Marketing mix is a combination of factors that can be controlled by a company to influence consumers to purchase its products. Everything in the marketing mix is controlled by the for P's, which are Price, Product, Promotion and Place. All these P's make up a plan for what a company will do next in order to advertise their product. When setting a price, advertisers look to set a price that is reasonable enough that will make consumers want to buy. For the product, advertisers need to make sure that their product is in good enough quality to be sold at whatever they set their price for. Promotion is when they decide how they will promote and advertise their product. Whether it's putting a huge ad on a taxi cab, a commercial, or a giant poster in the middle of Times Square. For place, they decide where will the product be sold most. For example, a company that sells surfboards will look to sell more surfboards in places like California and Hawaii more than they would in a place like Nebraska.</p>
<p>Last is Targeted audience. Targeted audience is as simple as it sounds. Companies have different marketing campaigns that are targeted to certain audiences. A good example of this would be Nike's highly rated recent commercial during the 2019 Oscar awards. It showed an abundance of female athletes breaking records, setting standards and doing things that most people would think Women can't do. That ad was clearly targeted towards women to buy their product.Another example can be Sprite having big African-American figures such as LeBron James and Migos advertising their product for a marketing campaign that will be aired on the BET network on television, where they know the majority of those viewers are also African-American. </p>
